## Motivation

Ever since the pandemic began, the Singapore government implemented a stay-at-home order - Circuit Breaker, which restricts group gatherings and enforces social distancing between users. (Goh, 2020) Many have since strayed away from the sedentary lifestyle and started exercising - be it doing HIIT workouts at home (O, 2020) or jogging outside. 

Statistics have shown that there has been a 30 per cent increase in customers interested in buying home equipment (fitness-related) during the pandemic. 

Due to social distancing measures, working out together physically has become very difficult and inconvenient, which greatly decreases the motivation to exercise 

## Aim

By having the option to customize and share different Workout Routines, users will not need to go through the trouble of searching up exercises on the internet. Instead, the app serves as a convenient and user-friendly one-stop solution. The Workout Routines can also be improved through the feedback of others who have tried the routine.

While providing users with a platform to share their workout details with each other may not replicate entirely the experience of working out together, it can serve to boost morale and motivation as users have the virtual companionship of one another.

## Frameworks
* Database (Google Firebase - Cloud Firestore)
* Vue.js
* Vuex
* Vue-router
* HTML/CSS

## How are we different from similar platforms?
As of now, applications available for use such as Strava and Nike Running Club do not support the feature of saving a friend's workouts. Unlike FITvt, they also do not support a chatting function on the app.
